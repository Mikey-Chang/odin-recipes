# odin-recipes
My first HTML project from the Odin Project.
Created index.html and used html boilerplate on all recipe and index pages. Moved image with "mv" command from desktop to the "odin-recipes" folder.
Formatted Recipe page and Index page with ingredients, steps, and an image with appropriate text tags.
