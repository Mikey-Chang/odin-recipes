    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken, cut up (or 8 pieces of your favorite cuts of chicken)</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp hot sauce</li>
        <li>2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>peanut oil</li>
        <li>flaked salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place 1 whole chicken, cut up in a large bowl. Sprinkle on top of the chicken: 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 teaspoons garlic powder and 2 teaspoons onion powder then toss to coat the chicken in the spices.</li>
        <li>Add 2 cups buttermilk and 2 Tablespoons hot sauce, stir until everything is combined. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but it is best if you can let it sit overnight.</li>
        <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together 2 cup all-purpose flour, 1 cup cornstarch, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, 2 teaspoons paprika and 2 teaspoons black pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Fill up a deep fryer (deep cast iron skillet or dutch oven) with peanut oil (or neutral frying oil of your choice) and preheat to 350°F.</li>
        <li>Taking the chicken pieces one at a time, let the excess buttermilk drip off. Coat in the flour mixture, make sure the chicken is well coated. Shake off any excess. Set the chicken aside and let it sit for a few minutes until the coating starts to look a little pasty.</li>
        <li>Carefully add the piece of chicken to the deep fryer and continue with the next piece. Don't add more than three or four pieces at at time. You will need to fry in batches so you do not overcrowd the fryer. Fry until golden brown, turning every few minutes.</li>
        <li>Chicken is done when golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Depending on the size of the chicken, dark meat can take about 12-14 minutes and white meat takes 8-10 minutes (these are estimates – use a meat thermometer for accurate doneness)</li>
        <li>When the chicken is done frying, place it on a paper towel lined sheet tray and immediately sprinkle a little flaked salt on top. Continue with the rest of the chicken pieces.</li>
    </ol>
